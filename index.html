      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an undergraduate student in the Bachelor of Economics and Finance.
        I was born and raised here in Melbourne. My bloodline is half Vietnamese and
        half Chinese except my main ethnicity is Vietnamese. I speak English and
        Vietnamese and a speck of words in Teochew which is a Southern Chinese dialect.
        I had many past interests throughout my life. I was into dancing during
        primary school and performed at Crown under Jasonâ€™s Ministry of Dance.
        During high-school I had interest in martials arts specifically taekwondo.
        Competed in local and state competitions and won several medals.
        My club would also participate in Lunar New Year Festivals
        and the Moomba Parade. </p>
      <h2>Information Technology</h2>
          <p>I simply do not have any interest in Information Technology. My field of knowledge
            in programming and software applications is unfortunately little to none.
            My mentor proposed a roughed-out guideline for my career path. He suggested
            I invest my time and knowledge into the field of IT, to be able to understand the
            language and design databases. As a result, to standout in my resume and hopes for,
            in future, take on the role as a Technical Consultant.</p>
          <p>I chose to study at RMIT simply due to its location in the city and the short
            distance and time to travel to RMIT. I studied the Diploma of
            International Business however after completion of my training.
            My interest altered to an economics standpoint where I pursue in consultancy.
            Hence, completing this course will gain me a fundamental understanding
            in Information Technology.</p>
          <p>I am in my final year of studying and I look forward learning
            new aspects of the economy and financial instruments.</p>
