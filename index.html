      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an undergraduate student in the Diploma of International Business at RMIT University. 
          Though completion, I found myself leaning towards an interest in information technology. 
          As a self-motivated and hard-working person. I took my own personal time and have learnt langauges
          such Javascript, HTML and CSS. Currently I am futher expanding my abilities and knowledge by
          understanding the full skills required to efficiently operate systems such as Python and SQL.
        and the Moomba Parade. </p>
      <h2>Information Technology</h2>
          <p>I simply do not have any interest in Information Technology. My field of knowledge
            in programming and software applications is unfortunately little to none.
            My mentor proposed a roughed-out guideline for my career path. He suggested
            I invest my time and knowledge into the field of IT, to be able to understand the
            language and design databases. As a result, to standout in my resume and hopes for,
            in future, take on the role as a Technical Consultant.</p>
          <p>I chose to study at RMIT simply due to its location in the city and the short
            distance and time to travel to RMIT. I studied the Diploma of
            International Business however after completion of my training.
            My interest altered to an economics standpoint where I pursue in consultancy.
            Hence, completing this course will gain me a fundamental understanding
            in Information Technology.</p>
          <p>I am in my final year of studying and I look forward learning
            new aspects of the economy and financial instruments.</p>
