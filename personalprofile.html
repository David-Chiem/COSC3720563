        <h3>Personal Interpretation</h3>
        <p>The completion of “What’s Your Learning Style” states that I am a tactile learner who learns best during
          hands-on activities such as meetings and plotting ideas and notes on a whiteboard.
          Nonetheless I am still versatile in absorbing content through visualisation and
          listening. On the other hand, the two other test provides no meaningful weight towards me,
          but as a simple reinforcement of who I am, as I am 100% conscious and aware of who I am, my capabilities
          and limitations. As the tests details that I am imaginative and had run through endless scenarios and environments in my mind,
          dove into the thesis of metaphysics of identity and currently reading the map of soul by Murray Stein. </p>
        <h3>Team influence</h3>
        <p>My personality will always determine the atmosphere of the team and its functionality however my behaviour will
             have a minor consequence towards the team.  Regarding productivity, forming meaningful relations within the team,
             henceforth, provides higher efficiency and a solid foundation throughout projects and initiatives.  The troublesome part
             is identifying the different learning styles each member has is crucial. As projects cannot always be hands-on but
             rather versatile to accommodate everyone. </p>
        <p>Subject to the roles and responsibilities of the job, I will do no less no more than what the job description requires. </p>
        <h3>Forming a team</h3>
          <p>The Big 5 Personality details my personality as a “commanding leader” who is straightforward and blunt to
          achieve the objective. However, it is best to have a second in command if my
          approach towards the team is deem excessive.
        Kinaesthetic learner would ideally work with other tactile learners for a stronger efficiency. Except acquiring
            specific available colleagues is implausible.  Hence acknowledging the different type of learners
            and provide flexible catering of delivery of information.</p>
