        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Project: Kench is an ascertainable vision to create an end-to-end solution for individuals to
          home cook their meals, healthy and stress-free. Development for a mobile device application that uses image
          recognition to scan food items. Once the user captures their desired items. The application will identify
          the food and compile a list that will then proceed to web-search recipes based on the compiled list.
          Finally, the software will offer the user with available recipes. The goal is to be commercially
          viable for all users by the closing stages of production.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>The Main Mission is to contribute to tackling climate change by reducing food wastage. Kench allows users
          to find recipes using left-over ingredients instead of dumping it into Mother Nature. The usability to
          discover recipes with a given amount of ingredients relieves the stress of the individuals. Rather than
          purchasing ingredients only to be used once and later disposed or ordering packaged fast-food. It provides
          a healthier lifestyle and is a sustainable solution to climate change.
          Furthermore, the interface can be seen as a financial solution for individuals on a budget.</p>

        <h2>Product Description</h2>
        <p><em>This section will provide an in-depth visualisation of the software application.</em></p>

        <!-- Begin Scan -->
        <p>Opening the application will lead to the home page of the app where users navigate. The homepage
          provides a list of 5 elements: Begin Scan, Social, Recipes, Settings and Exit.</p>
        <p>Selecting Begin Scan, with the permission from the user, the application will use the user’s device’s camera.
          A rough blueprint details a camera operating system. The interface will include functions located on
          the bottom of the screen, from left to right, a button that users can access the compiled list of
          ingredients, a white shutter shot and a flip camera option to allow users to use either
          the front or back camera.</p>
        <p>Users can take multiple shots of different items. The photos are then stored then image recognition identifies
          the ingredient and compiles a list. Accessing the compiled list of ingredients button will close the camera
          and open a new page that displays the list. Two options will be provided for the user to either return to the
          camera to continue snapping more photos or click on complete. The Complete button will web-search recipes in
          accordance with the limited ingredients and find suitable online recipes. The users can scroll and select their
          desired recipe which will redirect using the devices’ default internet browser to the online recipe</p>

          <!-- Social -->
        <p>Social function prompts a page where users can scroll down and view multiple cuisine pages and other user blogs.
           In addition to uploading their own home-cook meals with their profile accounts. Social
           posts are interactive so images can be liked, commented, shared and or saved.</p>

        <!-- Recipe -->
        <p>The Recipes function loads a history page of past accessed recipes used by the user in the form of URLs.</p>

        <!-- Settings -->
        <p>Settings component expands to a separate page that displays elements; Profile, Rewards, Options, Privacy and Security, Help and Legal and Sign Out.</p>
        <p>The profile will allow individuals to sign up or login using their email and password.
          After login, users can customise their icon to their preference. Update personal
           details and can post on the social media page.</p>
        <p>Account rewards page states daily login of the application counts as an entry ticket to
          win the annual rewards. Below the statement displays the list of rewards and the number of
          accumulated entries the user has acquired.  At the bottom of the page is a small text “terms and
          conditions” when expanded states the legal terms and eligibility</p>
        <p>Miscellaneous: All pages will have back to page button that will be located on the top left corner.
          Exit Button simply ends all software and closes the application</p>

        <h3> Application and Licences </h3>
        <p>Initiating project Kench to develop a mobile app using software includes start-up and on-going costs.
          Hence, the criteria for software applications revolves around pricing and licences. This project will
          proceed using Atom (free software) as the text editor for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JavaScript will
          also be used as a debugger application. Additional software
           is GCC with a General Public Licence (GPL) as a C++ compiler.</p>
        <p>For image and text recognition software, options available are
          the Google Cloud Vision API or Clarifai. Further calculations required
          to compare and determine the most suitable pricing.</p>
